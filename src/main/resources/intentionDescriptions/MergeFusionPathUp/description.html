Merges a fusion path to the parent block.
<p>
    If a fusion path (as part of an assignment or a block) is within a block, it will be moved to an assignment (or
    block) with the merged path.
</p>
<p>
    If a block contains multiple paths, only the current path will be pulled out and removed from the block.
